Breast Cancer Predictor

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for predicting whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on cell nuclei measurements. The application utilizes a machine learning model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Users can input cell nuclei measurements via sliders or upload their own data to receive predictions in real-time. The application provides visualizations, including radar charts depicting feature distributions and probabilities of malignancy.
